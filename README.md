# Data-visualization

Data Visualization is the graphical representation of information and data using visual elements like charts, graphs, and maps. It helps to easily understand trends, patterns, and insights in data, making complex information more accessible and easier to interpret.
Tableau is a visual analytics platform that allows you to create interactive visualizations without writing any code. Here's how the process works:

1. Open Tableau and Connect to Data
Launch Tableau and connect to your dataset. It supports many formats like Excel, CSV, SQL databases, and more.

2. Load and Preview the Data
Once connected, Tableau will show you a preview of your dataset. You can check if all data has been loaded correctly.

3. Drag Fields to Build Visuals
You can start creating charts by dragging fields (columns) onto the workspace:

Drag dimensions (e.g., Category, Date) to Rows or Columns.

Drag measures (e.g., Sales, Profit) to the chart area.

4. Choose Visualization Type
Tableau automatically suggests a suitable chart, but you can manually choose from options like bar chart, line graph, map, pie chart, and more using the "Show Me" panel.

5. Add Filters and Interactivity
You can filter your data visually by dragging fields into the filter section, or by creating drop-down filters for users to interact with the charts.

6. Customize the Chart
Edit titles, legends, labels, colors, and tooltips to make the visualization more understandable and visually appealing.

7. Create Dashboards (Optional)
Combine multiple visualizations into a dashboard for a complete view. Dashboards can be interactive and used in presentations or reports.

8. Export or Publish
You can export your visuals as images, PDFs, or publish them online using Tableau Public or Tableau Server.
